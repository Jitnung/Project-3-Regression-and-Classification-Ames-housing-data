TITLE: GA DSI07 Project 3: Regression and Classification (Ames housing data)

SUMMARY: This is my third assigned project at General Assembly (Singapore), as part of a 12-week Data Science Immersive course. The project involves building sales price and outlier predictor models based on housing data from Ames, Iowa. I also used the models to answer key business questions for an Ames-based property company.
